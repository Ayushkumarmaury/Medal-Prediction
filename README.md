Medal-Prediction:-
It is a ML model to predict how many medals a country going to win in a olympics.

Machine learning project steps:- Most machine learning projects follow a similar outline, which we'll also follow here. This outline will helps tackle any machine learning problem.

Project Steps:-

(1)Form a hypothesis. (2)Find and explore the data. (3)(If necessary) Reshape the data to predict your target. (4)Clean the data for ML. (5)Pick an error metric. (6)Split your data. (7)Train a model.

Data:- We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on Kaggle.
